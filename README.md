# fyntech.github.io
This is the GitHub pages site for http://fyntech.dk which we aim to update frequently, with new and exciting tech events.
This is a collaboration between members of [PROSA](http://prosa.dk) and the tech enthusiasts on Fyn, Denmark.  

## Adding an Event
To generate a new event, create a new file in the _events directory. 
Name the event file with the date and then the event name, format: y-m-d-title.md

Be sure to at least add a title, a date, and an organizer.
Events will be colored according to which category you choose, currently available categories:
codeodense, code-u-odense, eal, flug, ida, prosa, vuc & eal-prosa

Here's a sample event file, with all available fields:
```yaml

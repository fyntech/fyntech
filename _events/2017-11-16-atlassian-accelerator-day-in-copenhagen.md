We’re inviting you to a free breakfast-to-lunch seminar on Atlassian Enterprise.
<br><br>
This event will focus on "Atlassian high availability as code" where we will use Kubernetes, Docker, and other technologies to script the entire setup for an Atlassian Data Center solution.
<br><br>
To join the event, register here: <a href="http://www.code-conf.com/atlas-accel-17/cph2/#tickets">http://www.code-conf.com/atlas-accel-17/cph2/#tickets</a>
<br><br>
This is a great opportunity to chat with peers and experts, talk about your challenges, and share solutions on how to optimize Atlassian in your organization. You’ll bring home practical insights that you can apply immediately and the confidence to start making the most out of your Atlassian toolstack.
<br><br>
The target audience for this event is Atlassian system administrators, but you are more than welcome to join if you're simply interested in learning more.

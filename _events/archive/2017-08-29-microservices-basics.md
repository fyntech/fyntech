We thought it was time to discuss some of the hype, and also some of the downsides of microservices in a meetup in Odense. Microservices as an architectural pattern is defined by many people as different things, but I will adheer to Martin Fowler's explanation here: <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html</a><br/><br/>
The meetup will consist of a basic rundown of microservices using a homemade example, as well as sock shop (<a href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo">https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo</a>), and touch on Docker and Kubernetes as tools for orchestration of microservices.

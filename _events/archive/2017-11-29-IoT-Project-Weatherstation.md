<strong>Everyone knows that IoT is a part of the future, but how does one become a part of it? With this course, by using Arduino and sensors, build our own weather station system from hardware to software!</strong><br/><br/>
We are going to combine various hardware devices to create a data collection tool, and we will create the software that enables this collection and visualize it. It does not require programming- or hardware experience as that will be introduced, but knowledge of basic programming would be a plus.<br/><br/>
It's a requirement that you bring your own computer, preferable with Arduino IDE installed (https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). The hardware worth of 400 DKK will be sponsored by IDA and the weather station is yours after the event.<br/><br/>

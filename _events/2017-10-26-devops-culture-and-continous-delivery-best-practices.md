We want to do another meetup, this time talking about DevOps culture and how it influences a company.<br><br>
While a lot of people have come to call build engineers "DevOps engineers", this is not where the term originates from, and it is missing the point of what DevOps culture truly is, and how it impacts an organization - not just on a team to team level, but the whole way through.<br><br>
A good side topic for this is the core of it, which is continous delivery. These two topics are also what my coworker Alexandros Papadopoulos and myself experience the most in companies that we do consulting, so the presentation will have a healthy dosage of experience from the field.
